# Hybrid Cooling System using Air and Water

This project presents the design, development, and testing of a **Hybrid Cooling System** that combines **convective (indirect)** and **evaporative (direct)** cooling techniques using a copper coil and mist spray mechanism. The system is built to improve thermal performance, reduce energy consumption, and serve as a compact, sustainable alternative to traditional air-cooling setups.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Design a hybrid cooling prototype combining air and water-based cooling.
- Measure the **overall heat transfer coefficient**, **cooling effectiveness**, and **power requirements**.
- Compare system performance with conventional cooling towers.
- Demonstrate suitability for compact, low-resource, and sustainable environments.

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Indirect Cooling (Experiment 1):**  
  Hot air was passed over a **spiral copper tube** containing circulating cold water to enable convective heat exchange without direct contact.

- **Hybrid Cooling (Experiment 2):**  
  The setup was enhanced by adding a **mist spray**, allowing evaporative cooling alongside convection. This dual system was tested with a hair dryer (as the hot air source) and measured using thermocouples.
